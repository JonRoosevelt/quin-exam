# Check Launches

This application is done for people to check Launches of rockets. ðŸš€
It takes use of the [https://lldev.thespacedevs.com/docs/] API. 
It has a limit for requests so I added a way for running it locally:

Install json-rest globally with `npm i -g json-server` then run the API by running `npm run start:local`
